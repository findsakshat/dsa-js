### Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the maximum sum subarray within a given array of integers. The algorithm was developed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

#### Here's a high-level overview of how Kadane's Algorithm works:

1. Initialization: Initialize two variables, maxSoFar and maxEndingHere, to store the maximum sum found so far and the maximum sum ending at the current position, respectively. Set both variables to the value of the first element in the array.

2. Iterative Process: Iterate through the array, starting from the second element.

- For each element nums[i], update maxEndingHere to the maximum of either:
    - The current element nums[i].
    - The sum of the current element and the maximum sum ending at the previous position (maxEndingHere + nums[i]).
- Update maxSoFar to the maximum of either:
    - The current value of maxSoFar.
    - The current value of maxEndingHere.

3. Final Result: After iterating through the entire array, maxSoFar will contain the maximum sum of any subarray within the given array.

Kadane's Algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array, because it only requires a single pass through the array. Additionally, it has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional memory regardless of the size of the input array.

The intuition behind Kadane's Algorithm is based on the idea of dynamic programming, where the algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at each position and utilizes this information to determine the overall maximum sum subarray.
