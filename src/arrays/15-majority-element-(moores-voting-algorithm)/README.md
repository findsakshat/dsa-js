### Moore's Voting Algorithm

Moore's Voting Algorithm, also known as the Majority Vote Algorithm or the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm, is a method used to find the majority element in a sequence or array. The algorithm was proposed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1981.

#### Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialization: Initialize two variables, candidate and count. Set candidate to any value and count to 0.

2. Vote Counting: Iterate through the elements of the sequence. For each element:
  - If count is 0, set the current element as the candidate.
- If the current element is equal to the candidate, increment count by 1. Otherwise, decrement count by 1.

3. Final Check: After iterating through all elements, the candidate variable holds the potential majority element. However, it may not necessarily be the majority element. To confirm, iterate through the sequence again and count the occurrences of the candidate.

4. Verification: If the count of the candidate is greater than half the length of the sequence, then the candidate is considered the majority element. Otherwise, there is no majority element.

The algorithm's efficiency lies in its ability to find the majority element with a linear time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity.

The intuition behind the algorithm is based on the fact that if there is a majority element (an element that appears more than n/2 times), then it will eventually dominate the count as the algorithm progresses through the sequence, cancelling out the counts of other elements
